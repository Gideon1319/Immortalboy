            <b><i><u><h4>2. What is the difference Between the Artificial Intelligence and Data Science?</h4></u></i></b>
                <p3>
                    Both data science and artificial intelligence (AI) are umbrella terms for methods and techniques related to understanding and using digital data. Modern organizations collect information from a range of online and physical systems on every aspect of human life. We have text, audio, video, and image data available in large quantities. <a href="data science.html">Data Science</a> combines statistical tools, methods, and technology to generate meaning from data. <a href="Artificial.html">Artificial Intelligence</a> takes this one step further and uses the data to solve cognitive problems commonly associated with human intelligence, such as learning, pattern recognition, and human-like expression. It is a collection of complex algorithms that "learn" as they go, becoming better at solving problems over time.<br>

            <b><i><u><h4>4. what are the Careers of data science compared with artificial intelligence?</h4></u></i></b>
                <p5>
                    The main focus for a data scientist is typically technical, working deep in the data. Data scientists may work on the collection and processing of data, choosing the right models for the data, and interpreting results to make recommendations. Work may occur within specific software or systems, or even building systems themselves. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Types of roles</b><br>
                    <br>
                    Data science jobs include data scientist, data analyst, data engineer, machine learning engineer, research scientist, data visualization specialist, field-specific analyst roles, and more. AI also encompasses all of these roles. However, as the scope of the field is so broad, there are many additional associated roles and areas of job focus such as software developer, product manager, marketing specialist, AI tester, AI engineer, and more.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Skillset</b><br>
                    <br>
                    Data scientists have skills in the practical application of statistical and algorithmic methods to qualify and analyze data to find relevant insights. Data scientists require a background in statistical mathematics and computer science and proficiency in applicable tools.<br>
                    <br>
                    Depending on the role within AI, the skillset required may be more technical or soft skills-based. In some roles, there may be no technical experience required. For example, an AI software developer would need practical knowledge of relevant programming languages, libraries, and tools. However, an AI tester for a generative AI tool would require linguistic skills, creative thinking, and understanding how users should interact with the system.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Career progression<br></b>
                    <br>
                    As data science tools and workflows become more automated and productized, the number of pure data science roles decreases. Data science professionals seeking pure data science roles tend towards academic and cutting-edge applications. Analyst roles where the data scientist owns the operation of the tools remain relevant. From a junior role, data scientists gain more senior positions, move to people or project management, and even progress to chief data officer. <br>
                    <br>
                    Depending on the focus of the AI role itself, career progression can be similarly expected. You can progress to chief technology officer, chief marketing officer, chief product officer, and so on. Thinking critically about which jobs will be automated over the next ten years can help future-proof a career direction.<br>
