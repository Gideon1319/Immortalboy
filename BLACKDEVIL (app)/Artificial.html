<b><h1><font color="blue">What is artificial intelligence?</font></h1></b>
<p1>
    Artificial intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science dedicated to solving cognitive problems commonly associated with human intelligence, such as learning, creation, and image recognition. Modern organizations collect large volumes of data from diverse sources like smart sensors, human-generated content, monitoring tools, and system logs. The goal with AI is to create self-learning systems that derive meaning from data. Then, AI can apply that knowledge to solve new problems in human-like ways. For example, AI technology can respond meaningfully to human conversations, create original images and text, and make decisions based on real-time data inputs. Your organization can integrate AI capabilities in your applications to optimize business processes, improve customer experiences, and accelerate innovation.

<b><h1><font color="blue">How did artificial intelligence technology develop?</font></h1></b>
<p2>
    In Alan Turing’s seminal paper from 1950, "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," he considered whether machines could think. In this paper, Turing first coined the term artificial intelligence and presented it as a theoretical and philosophical concept. <br>
    <br>
    Between 1957 and 1974, developments in computing allowed computers to store more data and process faster. During this period, scientists further developed machine learning (ML) algorithms. The progress in the field led agencies like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to create a fund for AI research. At first, the main goal of this research was to discover whether computers could transcribe and translate spoken language.<br>
    <br>
    Through the 1980s, the boosted funding available and the expanding algorithmic toolkit scientists used in AI streamlined development. David Rumelhart and John Hopfield published papers on deep learning techniques, which showed that computers could learn from experience. <br>
    <br>
    From 1990 to the early 2000s, scientists achieved many core goals of AI, like beating the reigning world chess champion. With more computing data and processing power in the modern age than in previous decades, AI research is now more common and accessible. It's rapidly evolving into artificial general intelligence so software can perform complex tasks. Software can create, make decisions, and learn on their own, tasks previously limited to humans.<br>
</p2>

<b><h1><font color="blue">What are the key components of AI application architecture?</font></h1></b>
<p6>
    <br>
    Artificial intelligence architecture consists of four core layers. Each of these layers uses distinct technologies to perform a certain role. Next is an explanation of what happens at each layer.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Layer 1: data layer</b><br>
    <br>
    AI is built upon various technologies like machine learning, natural language processing, and image recognition. Central to these technologies is data, which forms the foundational layer of AI. This layer primarily focuses on preparing the data for AI applications. Modern algorithms, especially deep learning ones, demand vast computational resources. So, this layer includes hardware that act as a sub-layer, which provides essential infrastructure for training AI models. You can access this layer as a fully managed service from a third-party cloud provider.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Layer 2: ML frameworks and algorithm layer</b><br>
    <br>
    ML frameworks are created by engineers in collaboration with data scientists to meet the requirements of specific business use cases. Developers can then use prebuilt functions and classes to construct and train models easily. Examples of these frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn. These frameworks are vital components of the application architecture and offer essential functionalities to build and train AI models with ease.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Layer 3: model layer</b><br>
    <br>
    At the model layer, the application developer implements the AI model and trains it using the data and algorithms from the previous layer. This layer is pivotal for the AI system's decision-making capabilities.<br>
    <br>
    Here are some of the key components of this layer.<br>
    <br>
    <i>Model structure</i><br>
    <br>
    This structure determines a model's capacity, comprising layers, neurons, and activation functions. Depending on the problem and resources, one might choose from feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), or others.<br>
    <br>
    <i>Model parameters and functions</i><br>
    <br>
    The learned values during training, such as neural network weights and biases, are crucial for predictions. A loss function evaluates the model's performance and aims to minimize the discrepancy between the predicted and true outputs.<br>
    <br>
    <i>Optimizer</i><br>
    <br>
    This component adjusts the model parameters to reduce the loss function. Various optimizers like gradient descent and Adaptive Gradient Algorithm (AdaGrad) serve different purposes.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Layer 4: application layer</b><br>
    <br>
    The fourth layer is the application layer, which is the customer-facing part of AI architecture. You can ask AI systems to complete certain tasks, generate information, provide information, or make data-driven decisions. The application layer allows end users to interact with AI systems.<br>
</p6> 
<b><h1><font color="blue">What are the challenges in AI implementation?</font></h1></b>

You are accountable for customer data and privacy protection. To manage data security, your organization should have a clear understanding of how AI models use and interact with customer data across each layer.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Technical difficulties</b><br>
    <br>
    Training AI with machine learning consumes vast resources. A high threshold of processing power is essential for deep learning technologies to function. You must have robust computational infrastructure to run AI applications and train your models. Processing power can be costly and limit your AI systems' scalability.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Data limitations</b><br>
    <br>
    To train unbiased AI systems, you need to input huge volumes of data. You must have the sufficient storage capacity to handle and process the training data. Equally, you must have effective management and data quality processes in place to ensure the accuracy of the data you use for training.<br>
